# Space Invaders
This project was meant to recreate a working version of space invaders from scratch using things typically built into Windows. This project is now outdated and requires old dependencies to be installed to be functional.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Visual Basic Express, Aseprite

Aseprite was used to create the aptly named sprites for the enemies and player character. Visual Basic Express was used since at the time the powerpacks were included with Windows before they were removed with the release of the new Winforms designer, and VS 2019. VBE had an integrated GUI that could be manipulated alongside the code which made it an appealling language to build this project on at the time. Additionally since space invaders was visually simple, the performance costs were trivial(at least seemingly so).

## Optimizations

There seems to be some work needed to further optimize the game at run time, but due to the lack of support of the game's dependencies these would be difficult to implement. As more sprites are loaded into the game there seems to be an issue with dequeueing leading to performance loss and slowing overtime.

## End

This was an old project I should have uploaded when I initially made it, but at the time I was unfamiliar with github and was quite young. I've uploaded it here as a record and to possibly inspire anyone who stumbles across it to make whatever it is they want with whatever tools they have available.
